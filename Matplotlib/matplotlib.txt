Matplotlib is one of the most popular Python packages used for data visualization.
It is a cross platform library for making 2D plots from data un arrays.

It provides an object-oriented API that helps in embedding plots in applications using Python GUI toolkits such as
PyQt, WxPythonotTkinter
Matplotlib makes use of Numpy.


Matplotlib has a procedural interface named the Pylab, which is designed to resemble MATLAB, a proprietary 
programming language developed by MathWorks. 
Matplotlib along with NumPy can be considered as the open source equivalent of MATLAB.

Pyplot and PyLab are some of the modules in the matplotlib package.


Basice plot:
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

import numpy as np

import math

x = np.arange(0,2*math.pi, 0.05)
y = np.sin(x)

plt.plot(x,y)  #Setting the x and y axes values for the plot
plt.xlabel("angle")  #Setting the label for the x axis
plt.ylabel("sine")  #Setting the label for the y axis
plt.title("Sine wave")  #Setting the title of the plot
plt.show()


#PyLab
PyLab is a convenience module that bulk imports matplotlib.pyplot (for plotting) and NumPy (for Mathematics
and working with arrays) in a single name space. 

Although many examples use PyLab, it is no longer recommended.
