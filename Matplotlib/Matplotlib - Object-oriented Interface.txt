1. To begin with, we create a figure instance which provides an empty canvas.
fig = plt.figure()

2. Now add axes to figure. 
The add_axes() method requires a list object of 4 elements. 

ax=fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1])

Corresponding to left, bottom, width and height of the figure. 
Each number must be between 0 and 1


3. Set labels for x and y axis as well as title:
ax.set_title("sine wave")
ax.set_xlabel('angle')
ax.set_ylabel('sine')

4. Invoke the plot() method of the axes object.
ax.plot(x,y)




#Example:

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

import numpy as np

import math

#Creating the x and y axis values
x = np.arange(0, 2*math.pi, 0.05)
y = np.sin(x)

fig = plt.figure() #Creating the figure object

ax = fig.add_axes([0,0,1,1])  #Left, bottom, width and height of the axes
ax.plot(x,y)
ax.set_xlabel('angel')
ax.set_ylabel('sine')
ax.set_title('Sine wave')

plt.show()




1. Figure class
The matplotlib.figure module contains the Figure class. 
It is a top-level container for all plot elements. 
The Figure object is instantiated by calling the figure() function from the pyplot module.



2. Axes class
