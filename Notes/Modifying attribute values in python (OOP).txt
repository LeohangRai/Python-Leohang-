Modifying attribute values (OOP):
There are 3 ways to do this:
1. Change the value directly through an instance
2. Set the value through a method
3. Increment the value through a method

Let's say we have a code for a car class:



1. Moadifying an Attribute's value directly (Through an instance)
Trick -->
Create an obj of the class
To change:
obj.attribute = new_value


2. Modifying an attribute's value through a method:
Trick:
Create a method 
The parameter of the method should be --> The variable (value) that you want to assign to the attribute

Example:
def update_odometer(self, mileage):
        """Set the odometer reading to the given value"""
        self.odometer_reading = mileage

3. Incrementing an attributeâ€™s Value through a Method
Sometimes we may have to increment/decrement an attribute's valeu by certain amt rather tahn set an entirely 
new value.

Trick:
Create a method
The paramter may take the amt of incrementation or not.

If the attribute is to be incremeted/decremented by a fixed amount only (in every case)
(for example, always by 10), then we may not need to pass it as arg in the method call.

If the attribute is to be incremented/decremented by an amt specified by the method caller
(for example, if the odometer reading is to be modified by the miles specified by the user), then we pass
the miles as arg in the method.

Example:
def increment_odometer(self, miles):
        """Set the odometer reading to the given value"""
        self.odometer_reading += miles
