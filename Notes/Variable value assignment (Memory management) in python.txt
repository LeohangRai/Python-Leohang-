x = 12.2
Python, find us a spare piece of memory somewhere and
give it a label of x, and put 12.2 in it

y=14
And remember that, remember all that stuff.
That's one of things that Python does for us, it remembers stuff.
Then we go to the second statement.
It says oh, hey Python, find some spare memory that you got laying around,
label it y and put 14 into that


x = 100
hey, x, wait a sec.
I already told you about x, x already exists so don't go out and
grab any new memory, but stick 100 in that.
So 100 goes in and it wipes out the old value
