If the function is defined inside the class of that obj
i.e. if the obj has that function as attribute
Then we can call the function as 
obj.functionName()

But if the function is from some other class,
functionName(obj)


Example:
For the obj of list class

Let's say the functions to be applied are min() and insert()

min() cannot be applied as listobj.min()  #This will throw an attriute error
It can be called as min(listobj)

insert() can be applied though as listobj.insert()


This is because, list class has insert() function inside it, but not min().
