The user will enter a sentence and we have to check the sentence and store the frequency of each word as the value 
to the word as a key.

#Code Solution:

counts = dict()
sentence = input("Enter the sentence: ")

try:
    words = str(sentence).split()    
except:
    print("You must enter a valid sentence.")
    quit()

for word in words:
    counts[word] = counts.get(word, 0) + 1
    
print(counts)


#Doing the same thing but on a file
And also, this time returning the word that has the highest count and its frequency

filename = input("Enter the file name: ")
handle = open(filename)

count = dict()
for line in handle:
    line = line.rstrip()
    words = line.split()
    
    for word in words:
        count[word] = count.get(word, 0) +1

highest_word = 0
highest_word_frequency = 0

for key, value in count.items():
    if value > highest_word_frequency:
        highest_word_frequency = value
        highest_word = key
    
print(highest_word)
print(highest_word_frequency)
