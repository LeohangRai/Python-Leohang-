#Overriding Methods from the Parent Class 
You can override any method fr
om the parent class that doesn’t fit what you’re trying to model with the child class. 

To do this, you define a method in the child class with the same name as the method you want to override 
in the parent class. 

Python will disregard the parent class method and only pay attention to the method you define in the child class. 

Say the class Car had a method called fill_gas_tank(). 
This method is meaningless for an all-electric vehicle, so you might want to override this method. 

Here’s one way to do that:
class ElectricCar(Car):    
	--snip-
    def fill_gas_tank():        
	"""Electric cars don't have gas tanks."""        
	print("This car doesn't need a gas tank!")
