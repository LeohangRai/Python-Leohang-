Sometimes, we may need to know and keep track of the index of the elements inside a list while iterating through them.
For example, when we have to skip certaind index elements, we need to keep track of the index.

In tha case we cannot use the simple:
for item in items:

So, we may opt to using:
index = 0
while index<len(items):



>But there's an even more appropriate solution for this:
for i in range(len(items)):
    print items[i]

In this way, we can keep track of the index of the elements in the list and manipulate it as well.
