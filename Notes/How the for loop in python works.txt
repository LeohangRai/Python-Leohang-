#How For loop works:
Note: For Loop does the same thing and handles the StopIteration exception.
So in the bg, the for loop is basically doing the following things:
1. It first gets the iterator of our obj  (By calling the __iter__ function on the  obj)  [Ex: i_nums = iter(nums)]
2. Then it gets the next values (By calling the __next__  function) [Ex: next(i_nums)]
	Until it hits the StopIteration exception
3. next values are returned using while loop

#Creating the for loop
nums = [1,3,5]
i_nums = (iter(nums))
while True:
    try:
        item = next(i_nums)
        print(item)
    except StopIteration:
        break


Note: The for loop doesn't directly iterate on the container. It first converts the 
container into an iterator.
