Python variables:

Can put characters, underscore and numbers.
Can only start with either a character or underscore
Cannot start with numbers though
Case Sensitive
Can start with underscore:
_343Variable
Cannot be same as keywords like (try, catch, len)
All CAPS VARIABLES are usually used to represent variables that don't change
throughout the script. (Like parameters)

myvariable_324 is acceptable

can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
_24_bars_of_chocolate


type(var)-->returns the type of the var

myvar= date(year=2019, month=4, day=1)
date Data type



#Multiple values to variables
num1 = num2 = num3 = 10 # assigns the number 10 to all three variables
print(num1, num2, num3)
--->10 10 10


a, b, c = 5, 'R', 'S' # assigns different values to each variable
print(a, b, c)   
--->5 R S


#Data types in Python

    Numbers Data Types (int, float, complex etc)
    list Data Type
    tuple Data Type
    dict Data Type
    str Data Type
    set Data Type


Note:
Unlike other languages, Python does not have an explicit long type. In fact, Python's int can store values as large as C's long, 
and for larger numbers, Python automatically casts numbers into a special type called BigNum. 
This can store arbitrarily large numbers in it.


#Deleting a var or object:
del num1
