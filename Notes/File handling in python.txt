handle = open('filename', 'mode')

the open statement is called a handler

File handle is not the data, it's just a way to get at the data. It is like a connetor.
That they're not actually the data, but a thing we can manipulate.
So, this handle is something that's sort of
a porthole between your program and this file that's sitting on the disk. 


NOTE:
Just like a string variable is a sequence of characters 
A handle is a sequence of lines.

Example:
handle = open('file.txt', r)

for i in handle:
    print(i)

i will be the iteration variable which carries the lines of the handle.

NOTE: Every line has a \n at the end.
So if we print(line), we will get an extra linespace.
It is because, 1 \n is obtained from the end of the line and the other from the print statement's end = '\n'


#Program to count the num of lines in a file
handle = open('hello.txt')
count = 0
for i in handle:
    count+=1
print(count)



#read method 
handle.read() 
will read the whole file
