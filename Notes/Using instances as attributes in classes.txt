Let's say we have a class Car and another class Battery.
Then we can use the instance of Battery class as an attribute in the car class.

Example:
#Creating a Car that will have Battery class instance as an attribute.

class Battery():
    def __init__(self, size = 70):
        self.size = size
        
    def desc_battery(self):
        print("This car has a "+str(self.size)+" KWh battery")
 

class Car():
    def __init__(self, company, model):
        self.company = company
        self.model = model
        self.battery = Battery()  #This is the instance of Battery class initiailized with default value.
        
my_car = Car('Tesla','LEO')
my_car.battery.desc_battery()

>This car has a 70 KWh battery


NOTE:
To access the attributes/methods of the instance(Battery) through the Car object, we need to acess them as:
car_obj.battery_obj.attribute_name
car_obj.battery_obj.method_name
