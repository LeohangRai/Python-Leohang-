#Comparison of tuples

If we compare 2 tuples, only the first item of each tuple are compared:
For Example:
(0,1,2) < (5,1,2)
> True

Here, the thing that happens is:  0<5

If the first items are same, it looks for the second item and so on.
Example:
(0, 1, 2000) < (0, 3, 4)
> True

This can be taken as 012 and 512:
If the first digit of first num is less than that of the second 
it means that the first num is less than the second num as a whole.


This can be applied to strings as well.
('Jones', 'Sally') < ('Jones', 'Sam')
> True

Because in Sally and Sam, l comes before m.
