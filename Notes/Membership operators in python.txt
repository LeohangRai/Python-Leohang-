Membership operators

Membership Operators in Python are used to validate whether a value is present in a sequence 
(or if substring is present in a string). There are two membership operators in Python. They are very simple.

1. in – This operator returns True if the value is found in sequence.

2. not in – This operator returns True if the value is NOT found in sequence.

# Testing memberships in a List 

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
print('a' in letters) 		# Checking if the letter 'a' is IN the list
>True


print('g' not in letters)  	# Checking if the letters 'g' is NOT IN the list
>True


# Testing memberships in a string
word = 'photosynthesis'
print('photo' in word) # Checking if the substring 'photo' is in the string
>True
