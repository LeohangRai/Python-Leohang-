Pandas is an open-source Python Library providing high-performance data manipulation and analysis tool using its powerful data 
structures.
The name is derived from form the word Panel Data (an Econometrics from Multidimensional Data).

Using Pandas, we can accomplish five typical steps in the processing and analysis of data 
-->load, prepare, manipulate, model, and analyze.

#Pandas data structures
1. Series
2. DataFrames
3. Panel 

NOTE: The higher dimensional data structure is a container of its lower dimensional data structure.
For example, DataFrame is  a container of Series, Panel is a container of DataFrame.

-->These data structures are built on top of Numpy array, which means they are fast.


1. Series: a 1D data structure (1D ndarray) that can store values.
And for every value it holds a unique index.
- homogeneous array
- size immutable
- values of data mutable

2. DataFrame: a 2 or morre dimensional data structure (array).
Basically a table with rows and columns.
The columns have names and rows have indices.
- heterogeneous data
- size mutable
- data mutable


3. Panel:
- General 3D labeled, 
- size-mutable array.
- data mutable


#Mutability
All Pandas data structures are value mutable (can be changed) and except Series all are size mutable. 
Series is size immutable.
